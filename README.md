Voice Recognition and Identification

1. Read Audio file : DONE
2. Convert to Features 
3. Extract Features {with MFCC and Mel Spectogram}
4. Design a unsupervised neural network with ICA and supervised initial prediction {supervised network predicts how many voices are there and ICA with further forward to }
5. Generate data for deep learning by mixing audio files by single actors
6. Train network with partial fit
7. Deploy with continual learning in android.
