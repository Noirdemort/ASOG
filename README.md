Voice Recognition and Identification

1. Read Audio file : DONE
2. Convert to Features 
3. Extract Features {with MFCC and Mel Spectogram}
4. Design a unsupervised neural network with RNN, CNN (for prediction of number of voices) and Auto-encoder with KMeans frontend (for feature enhancement for voice separation).
5. Generate data for deep learning by mixing audio files by single actors
6. Train network with partial fit
7. Deploy with continual learning in android.
